		<div class="chapter-content">
			<p>Sunday arrives looking almost innocent.</p>
			<p>The fog has been thinning for days, and today the lane does not hide behind white curtains at all. The neem leaves show their dusty green plainly. A thin winter sun sits in the sky like a coin someone has forgotten to pick up.</p>
			<p>Priya wakes before anyone calls her.</p>
			<p>For a moment she lies still and listens to the house doing its smallest sounds: Sunita’s bangles clinking once in the kitchen, a pressure cooker lid being moved, Arjun turning a page with the seriousness of a person turning destiny. Somewhere outside, a cycle bell rings and then gets swallowed by distance.</p>
			<p>It is Sunday.</p>
			<p>In their house, Sunday means two things at the same time: rest and preparation.</p>
			<p>Priya sits up and automatically reaches for her phone.</p>
			<p>Not to check any portal today. Not to refresh any status.</p>
			<p>To check the clock.</p>
			<p>6:58.</p>
			<p>Monday is sitting inside the numbers already.</p>
			<p>She swings her feet down, pulls her shawl around her shoulders, and goes to the shelf above the trunk. The plastic folder is there, fat with paper like a book that only she reads. She takes it down and opens it the way some people open a box of sweets—carefully, with a small fear of dropping something.</p>
			<p>The PAN acknowledgement is still lying flat between the BA confirmation slip and an Aadhaar copy. Sharma Ji’s warning echoes in her head.</p>
			<p><em>Don’t fold like samosa.</em></p>
			<p>She smiles once, despite herself.</p>
			<p>On the floor, next to the folder, her keyboard waits in its usual place. The yellow marigold petal stuck between two keys is still there. It has dried now, light as a thin paper.</p>
			<p>Priya touches the F and J bumps the way she touches the edge of a new idea.</p>
			<p>In the kitchen, Sunita says without turning, “Uth gayi (you’re up).”</p>
			<p>Priya answers, “Haan (yes),” and the word comes out soft.</p>
			<p>Sunita is making chai. The milk boils over once, just a little, as if the stove is also waking reluctantly.</p>
			<p>Arjun is sitting on the floor with his notebook and the phone propped beside him. The typed lyrics Priya made yesterday are open on the screen.</p>
			<p>He is whisper-singing with great concentration, and still getting it wrong.</p>
			<p>“Vande Mataram… sujalam…,” he says, and then mutters, “<em>safalam</em>… <em>malayaja</em>… what is this? It sounds like a medicine.”</p>
			<p>Priya sits beside him and points with her finger. “Read slow. It is not a race.”</p>
			<p>Arjun sighs like she is ruining his artistic flow. “Tomorrow everyone will sing loudly. Nobody will read slow.”</p>
			<p>“Then tomorrow everyone will sing wrong loudly,” Priya says.</p>
			<p>Sunita laughs once. “Let him. Republic Day will not cancel because Arjun doesn’t know one line.”</p>
			<p>The words—Republic Day—sit in Priya’s mind like a calendar page.</p>
			<p>Tomorrow.</p>
			<p>A national holiday.</p>
			<p>And also, her first day of coming daily to the clinic.</p>
			<p>The clinic desk woman has said it plainly: <em>Monday, ten to two.</em></p>
			<p>Priya thinks of the clinic’s register, the printer, the quick faces, the way the woman tests people by making them do real work. She has not said, “Except holidays.”</p>
			<p>Priya does not want to be the person who starts a new job by assuming she can rest.</p>
			<p>After chai, Sunita pulls out a steel plate of clothes that have been washed and dried—Sunday laundry, folded into rectangles.</p>
			<p>“Wear this tomorrow,” she says, handing Priya a plain salwar-kameez and a sweater that still smells faintly of sun.</p>
			<p>Priya holds the sweater to her face for a second.</p>
			<p>It smells like the roof.</p>
			<p>Sunita points with her chin toward the folder. “You will take that. Flat.”</p>
			<p>“I will,” Priya says.</p>
			<p>“And take two pens,” Sunita adds.</p>
			<p>Priya looks up.</p>
			<p>“One pen is enough,” she says automatically.</p>
			<p>Sunita gives her a look that is half mother and half accountant. “One pen is enough until the pen decides it is tired. Take two.”</p>
			<p>Priya nods. “Theek hai (okay).”</p>
			<p>Rakesh appears at the courtyard door, rubbing his eyes. His face looks like someone has erased him and drawn him again quickly. He has slept, but not fully.</p>
			<p>“Tomorrow you are going?” he asks.</p>
			<p>Priya pauses. She expects him to say <em>don’t go, it is holiday,</em> or <em>go, don’t miss the chance,</em> but he only asks, as if he is checking the weather.</p>
			<p>“Yes,” she says. “They told Monday.”</p>
			<p>Rakesh nods slowly. “Go. Reach time pe (on time).”</p>
			<p>The phrase is small, but it lands in her chest like a weight that is also support.</p>
			<p>After breakfast, Priya spreads her things on the floor the way she spreads vegetables before cutting them.</p>
			<p>Plastic folder.</p>
			<p>Aadhaar copies.</p>
			<p>The little passport photos that remain.</p>
			<p>The ₹300 from Vasant Panchami, folded and refolded.</p>
			<p>Two pens—one blue, one black.</p>
			<p>A small hair clip that always disappears when she needs it.</p>
			<p>And her phone, with the OTG adapter tucked into its cover like a secret tool.</p>
			<p>She looks at the pile and thinks: this is what a job looks like.</p>
			<p>Not the job itself.</p>
			<p>The things that allow the job to happen.</p>
			<p>She opens her notebook and writes a list, because her hand cannot help itself.</p>
			<p><strong>MONDAY</strong></p>
			<p>10–2</p>
			<ul>
			<li>folder (flat)</li>
			<li>2 pens</li>
			<li>water bottle</li>
			<li>₹ for bus</li>
			<li>don’t guess</li>
			</ul>
			<p>She reads the last line again.</p>
			<p><em>Don’t guess.</em></p>
			<p>It is becoming a prayer.</p>
			<p>Her phone buzzes.</p>
			<p>A small notification.</p>
			<p><em>New mail.</em></p>
			<p>Priya stares at it.</p>
			<p>Mail.</p>
			<p>Yesterday she watched Sharma Ji make her email like he was making a photocopy—quick, impatient, inevitable. Today, the email is behaving like a real thing. It is arriving.</p>
			<p>She opens it with a careful thumb.</p>
			<p>The screen shows a subject line in English. She reads it slowly, moving her lips.</p>
			<p>“Welcome…”</p>
			<p>Below it, a long paragraph sits like a wall of small letters.</p>
			<p>Priya scrolls. The words talk about security, about keeping passwords safe, about “terms.” She doesn’t understand everything, but she understands one thing clearly: the email is talking to her as if she is a person who knows what she is doing.</p>
			<p>It is a strange feeling.</p>
			<p>She switches to WhatsApp and sends Sana a typed message.</p>
			<p><em>Didi, I got first mail. It says welcome. Is it ok?</em></p>
			<p>She hesitates at “Didi.” Sana is not her sister, but sometimes Priya calls her that when she wants reassurance without begging.</p>
			<p>She presses send.</p>
			<p>The blue tick appears a minute later.</p>
			<p>Sana replies immediately, also typed.</p>
			<p><em>Haan ok. Everyone gets welcome mail. Don’t click random links. Keep password safe. Tomorrow you going clinic?</em></p>
			<p>Priya’s fingers hover.</p>
			<p>She types, deletes, types again.</p>
			<p>Finally she writes:</p>
			<p><em>Yes. Even holiday. Better go.</em></p>
			<p>Sana sends a voice note this time. Priya plays it near her ear.</p>
			<p>“Pagal (crazy),” Sana says affectionately. “But haan, go. If closed you will come back. Take water. Take biscuit. And keep receipt number paper safe. Flat. Like you keep all things.”</p>
			<p>Priya smiles at the last part.</p>
			<p>Sana knows her too well.</p>
			<p>By late morning, Arjun has gone out for practice on the school ground. He has his white shirt on, tucked in with unusual obedience, because today he wants to look like a person in a parade.</p>
			<p>As he leaves, he sings loudly on purpose, to show the lane he is patriotic.</p>
			<p>“Vande Mataram!” he shouts.</p>
			<p>A neighbour’s aunt scolds him from a doorway. “Arre, slowly! My baby is sleeping.”</p>
			<p>Arjun salutes her badly and runs.</p>
			<p>Priya watches him go and feels a small softness.</p>
			<p>He is sixteen and still running.</p>
			<p>She is twenty-two and making piles of paper.</p>
			<p>In the afternoon, the sun warms the courtyard enough that Sunita sits in the doorway and sorts lentils in a steel tray. The sound—tiny clicks of stones removed—is as steady as a clock.</p>
			<p>Priya takes her keyboard and connects it to her phone.</p>
			<p>The message appears again: <em>Physical keyboard connected.</em></p>
			<p>She sets a timer.</p>
			<p>Fifteen minutes.</p>
			<p>Today she does not practice random letters.</p>
			<p>She practices her own future.</p>
			<p>She opens a blank note and types the address of the clinic the way she remembers it—canal road, the turn, the small signboard. She types “10:00” again and again, not because she will forget, but because the numbers feel like they need to become familiar in her fingers.</p>
			<p>Then she types the sentence Sharma Ji taught her:</p>
			<p><em>Number not clear. Please tell again.</em></p>
			<p>She types it three times.</p>
			<p>The words look stiff on the screen, like someone wearing a new shirt.</p>
			<p>But they are her words now.</p>
			<p>When the timer rings, she stops immediately.</p>
			<p>Sunita notices and nods once, approving. In their house, stopping on time is a kind of discipline that people respect.</p>
			<p>Evening comes early, as it does in January.</p>
			<p>The lane fills with small movements: men returning with vegetables, children playing with paper flags they have bought for two rupees, a scooter passing with a tricolour ribbon tied to its handle.</p>
			<p>From somewhere, a loudspeaker plays a patriotic song in a crackling voice.</p>
			<p>Priya goes to the roof for a minute, not because she has to, but because Sunday allows it.</p>
			<p>The sky is clear in a way that makes the stars feel close, waiting.</p>
			<p>She thinks of tomorrow again.</p>
			<p>She thinks of the clinic desk woman’s face when she says, “Come daily.”</p>
			<p>She thinks of herself standing at the bus stand with her folder pressed flat against her body like a shield.</p>
			<p>She thinks of the welcome mail sitting in her phone like a new door.</p>
			<p>Back downstairs, she lays out her clothes for the morning.</p>
			<p>She puts the folder on top of them, so it cannot be forgotten.</p>
			<p>She puts two pens beside the folder, as if they are small guards.</p>
			<p>Then she opens her phone’s clock.</p>
			<p>She sets an alarm.</p>
			<p>7:30.</p>
			<p>She stares at it.</p>
			<p>It looks too early. It looks like someone else’s life.</p>
			<p>Then she sets another one.</p>
			<p>7:45.</p>
			<p>Two alarms.</p>
			<p>Not because she doesn’t trust herself.</p>
			<p>Because she is learning that trust can be practical.</p>
			<p>When she lies down, the house is already shifting into night quiet. Rakesh is coughing once, then settling. Sunita is turning off the last light.</p>
			<p>Priya looks at the ceiling and feels the strange new weight of tomorrow.</p>
			<p>It is not fear, exactly.</p>
			<p>It is the feeling of something beginning.</p>
			<p>In the darkness, her phone screen glows once, as if to check she is still there.</p>
			<p>Two alarms wait.</p>
			<p>A receipt number rests flat in its folder.</p>
			<p>And somewhere in the lane, a boy sings “Vande Mataram” wrong but happily.</p>
			<p>Priya closes her eyes and lets the ordinary comfort of that wrongness settle her.</p>
			<p>For now, that is enough.</p>
