			<p>Saturday arrives grey and close.</p>
			<p>Fog sits on everything—the neem leaves, the courtyard wall, even the sound of the highway.</p>
			<p>Priya wakes and, without thinking, rubs her thumb over the place where an F key would be.</p>
			<p>Only blanket.</p>
			<p>She laughs quietly at herself.</p>
			<p>Sunita is up. She always is. The stove flame is low and patient. The kettle sits on it like a person sitting close to a fire, absorbing heat without complaint.</p>
			<p>“<em>Thand bahut hai</em>,” Sunita says—so much cold—and the sentence feels less like news and more like a fact everyone has signed.</p>
			<p>Priya wraps her shawl tighter and pours chai into two steel tumblers. One is for Sunita. One is for the room where Rakesh sleeps.</p>
			<p>He came back after dawn, a little later than usual, scarf pulled up to his eyes.</p>
			<p>Now his breathing is even. The house adjusts itself around it.</p>
			<p>Arjun is at the table, pretending he is studying. His book is open. His mind is somewhere else.</p>
			<p>“You have school today?” Priya asks, because even asking has become part of their cold-wave routine.</p>
			<p>Arjun makes a face. “Saturday class,” he says as if it is a personal insult. “They will send homework. Then they will say ‘write neatly’. As if neatness will improve network.”</p>
			<p>Priya nudges his elbow. “Write your name neatly at least.”</p>
			<p>Arjun looks at her quickly, then at her fingers. He smirks. “Madam typist.”</p>
			<p>Priya can’t help smiling. The word feels too big for her, but it also feels… possible.</p>
			<p>Sunita sets a plate of potato-stuffed parathas between them. “Eat. Fog eats people who don’t eat,” she says, half-joking.</p>
			<p>Priya takes a bite. The paratha is hot enough to make her eyes water. She feels thankful for simple heat.</p>
			<p>Her phone lies face-down beside her notebook. She turns it over.</p>
			<p>No new message.</p>
			<p>The status bar at the top of the screen shows two thin lines of network, like a weak promise.</p>
			<p>She tells herself not to open the college portal. Not yet.</p>
			<p>Instead, she opens WhatsApp.</p>
			<p>A voice note from Sana is waiting, sent late last night.</p>
			<p>Priya presses play.</p>
			<p>“Priya, you did it, okay?” Sana’s voice is loud enough to cut through fog. “You got paid also, na? <em>Bahut sahi</em>—very good. Don’t stop now. Ask Sharma Ji if he has regular typing—even small-small. Money is money.</p>
			<p>And stop checking that portal every hour. If it is under review, let it be under review.”</p>
			<p>Priya snorts into her chai.</p>
			<p>Sunita looks up. “What happened?”</p>
			<p>“Sana is giving lecture,” Priya says.</p>
			<p>Sunita nods, satisfied. “Good. Friends should give lecture. Family gives only taunts.”</p>
			<p>Arjun makes an offended noise. “I give both.”</p>
			<p>The kettle whistles. Priya stands, pours a tumbler for her father, and leaves it near his bed without waking him.</p>
			<p>On the way back, she pauses by the shelf above the trunk and slides out her plastic folder—receipts, acknowledgements, and that familiar line: <em>Application under review.</em></p>
			<p>She finds the scrap paper and reads it.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Priya Verma (x5)</li>
			<li>as df (x10)</li>
			<li>jk kl (x10)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>And beneath it, in Sharma Ji’s quick hand, one extra line she hadn’t noticed properly yesterday:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>1–2–3–4 (index fingers only)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Priya laughs again, surprised by how bossy the line looks.</p>
			<p>“Where are you going?” Sunita asks.</p>
			<p>Priya hesitates, then says it plainly. “To practice.”</p>
			<p>Arjun lifts his eyebrows. “In this fog?”</p>
			<p>“Just to Sharma Ji,” Priya says. “Not to America.”</p>
			<p>Arjun grins. Sunita sighs in that way that means permission has been granted.</p>
			<p>“Go,” Sunita says. “But walk slowly. Fog is… <em>badmash</em>—mischievous.”</p>
			<p>Priya steps outside.</p>
			<p>The lane smells like damp earth and woodsmoke. Somewhere, someone is burning something to fight the cold—old leaves, maybe, or bits of cardboard. The smoke hangs low, unable to rise.</p>
			<p>At the bus stand, Chai Uncle’s stall is open, a small island of steam and gossip.</p>
			<p>He sees Priya and lifts a tumbler in greeting. “Madam! Today also papers?”</p>
			<p>“Today fingers,” Priya says.</p>
			<p>Chai Uncle clucks with approval, as if she has announced she is going to temple.</p>
			<p>He pours her chai with extra adrak—ginger—without asking, and then points to a phone lying beside his cash box.</p>
			<p>“My nephew sent,” he says. “IMD warning.”</p>
			<p>Priya leans in. The message is a forwarded screenshot: <em>Very Dense Fog</em> for coming days, some lines about cold wave.</p>
			<p>Chai Uncle squints at the screenshot. “Very dense fog,” he reads, then snorts. “Fog is fog.”</p>
			<p>Priya looks at the words and thinks of her own screen: <em>under review</em>.</p>
			<p>Chai Uncle taps the phone with a tobacco-stained finger. “Warning means—don’t be hero. Walk slow. Drink chai.”</p>
			<p>Priya sips. “I am following third point,” she says.</p>
			<p>Chai Uncle laughs, pleased with her.</p>
			<p>A shared auto passes, headlights dimmed by fog. The driver honks twice, not to threaten anyone, just to announce existence.</p>
			<p>Priya finishes her chai, warms her hands around the tumbler until her fingers feel alive again, and continues.</p>
			<p>Sharma Ji’s shop is open. The shutter is lifted a little higher than yesterday, but the shop still feels like it is waking reluctantly.</p>
			<p>The printer coughs once, as if to say it is also cold.</p>
			<p>Sharma Ji looks up. “You came again.”</p>
			<p>“I said I will practice,” Priya says.</p>
			<p>“<em>Haan haan</em>—yes yes,” Sharma Ji mutters, as if her determination is an inconvenience. “Fifteen minutes. And don’t press keys like you are killing mosquitoes.”</p>
			<p>Priya sits.</p>
			<p>The keyboard is warm today. Not borrowed warmth—earned warmth from the hands of people who have been here since morning.</p>
			<p>She places her index fingers on F and J.</p>
			<p>Bumps.</p>
			<p>Her shoulders drop a little.</p>
			<p>She opens a blank document and starts with the simplest thing: numbers.</p>
			<p>1 2 3 4</p>
			<p>She tries using only her index fingers, as instructed. It is slower than she wants, but it feels clean. Like drawing a straight line with a ruler.</p>
			<p>Sharma Ji watches for a moment, then turns away to argue with someone on the phone about a scan.</p>
			<p>Priya moves to her name.</p>
			<p>Priya Verma.</p>
			<p>She types it five times. On the third time she forgets the space. She fixes it. She feels, ridiculously, proud of the space.</p>
			<p>A man comes in asking about a ticket; Sharma Ji points to a stool and says, “Sit. Wait.”</p>
			<p>Priya tries not to let the presence of strangers make her fingers stiff.</p>
			<p>She tells herself: these people don’t know her. They don’t know how new this is.</p>
			<p>She returns to as df and jk kl.</p>
			<p>Her mistakes are fewer. Her backspaces are quicker.</p>
			<p>After fifteen minutes, Sharma Ji says, “Bas.”</p>
			<p>Priya lifts her hands and flexes her fingers like they are small tired workers.</p>
			<p>She is about to stand when Sharma Ji, without looking at her, says, “Do you know how to type in English properly? Like sentence?”</p>
			<p>Priya hesitates. “Little.”</p>
			<p>He slides a small notebook across the counter. “One uncle wants a complaint letter typed for the electricity office. He wrote in Hindi. You can type Hindi?”</p>
			<p>Priya’s heart does a small somersault. “I can try.”</p>
			<p>Sharma Ji flips the keyboard settings and points to the screen. “Type. Clean. Then I print.”</p>
			<p>Priya stares at the Hindi letters on the screen and starts slow.</p>
			<p>Dear Sir,</p>
			<p>Then Hindi.</p>
			<p>Her fingers search, clumsy. The letters are not where her mind expects them to be. It is like walking in fog—you know the road, but your feet still hesitate.</p>
			<p>Behind her, the man waiting on the stool clears his throat. Someone outside honks. The printer coughs again.</p>
			<p>Priya keeps going.</p>
			<p>She doesn’t get everything perfect. Once, a matra lands in the wrong place and the word looks like it is winking. She fixes it.</p>
			<p>Sharma Ji leans over her shoulder once, points at a mistake, says nothing.</p>
			<p>Priya corrects it.</p>
			<p>Twenty minutes later, the letter is done.</p>
			<p>It looks official in that plain-font way official things do. The words sit in straight lines, disciplined.</p>
			<p>Sharma Ji prints it and hands it to her.</p>
			<p>“Good,” he says, as if the word costs him.</p>
			<p>He pulls out a fifty and then, after a pause, adds a ten-rupee coin.</p>
			<p>“Sixty,” he says. “Hindi is harder.”</p>
			<p>Priya’s ears heat up. “Thank you,” she says quickly.</p>
			<p>Sharma Ji waves her away. “Go. And tell the uncle—check letter before giving. People make mistakes, office catches and then they shout. Not my shouting.”</p>
			<p>Priya nods solemnly, as if she has just been given a government post.</p>
			<p>Outside, the fog has thinned slightly. The lane is still pale, but shapes are clearer.</p>
			<p>Priya walks home carefully, fingers inside her shawl, feeling the coin’s cold edge through the cloth.</p>
			<p>At home, Arjun is still at the table. His book is open to the same page. His pen has moved only a little.</p>
			<p>He looks up, curious despite himself. “Practice?”</p>
			<p>Priya places the sixty on the table.</p>
			<p>Arjun’s eyes widen. “Again?”</p>
			<p>Sunita comes from the kitchen, wiping her hands on her dupatta. She sees the money and immediately looks past it to Priya’s face.</p>
			<p>Priya hands her the printed letter. “Typed in Hindi,” she says.</p>
			<p>Sunita’s eyebrows rise. “Hindi also?”</p>
			<p>Priya shrugs, trying to look casual. Inside, she feels like she has climbed something.</p>
			<p>Sunita reads the first line, lips moving, then nods once. “<em>Shabaash</em>—well done.”</p>
			<p>Priya tucks the ten-rupee coin into her notebook and the fifty under the elastic band where her emergency cash used to live alone.</p>
			<p>Not alone now, she thinks.</p>
			<p>Later, when Rakesh wakes, he drinks the cold chai without complaint and asks only one question: “Fog still?”</p>
			<p>Sunita says, “IMD says very dense.”</p>
			<p>Rakesh makes a sound from deep in his chest. “Then I will leave early for shift.”</p>
			<p>Priya wants to tell him about the sixty. She wants to say: I worked.</p>
			<p>But she remembers Sunita’s advice from yesterday—let him sleep, don’t give him worry—and she adjusts her words.</p>
			<p>“I went to practice,” she says instead.</p>
			<p>Rakesh looks at her hands. His eyes soften. “Good,” he says. “Learn. But don’t catch cold doing learning.”</p>
			<p>Priya nods.</p>
			<p>In the evening, when the fog returns, she checks the college portal once.</p>
			<p>Still: <em>Application under review.</em></p>
			<p>For a moment, the familiar pinch rises.</p>
			<p>Then she looks at her notebook—at the two neat lines that weren’t there a week ago.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Typed customer list — ₹50</li>
			<li>Typed Hindi letter — ₹60</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The pinch loosens.</p>
			<p>Some things are under review, she tells herself.</p>
			<p>Some things are already approved.</p>
			<p>She lies down, tucks her hands under the quilt, and presses her fingertips together lightly.</p>
			<p>Not prayer.</p>
			<p>Just practice, even in the dark.</p>
