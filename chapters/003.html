		<div class="chapter-content">
			<p>Rakesh comes home when the sky is still deciding what shade it wants to be.</p>
			<p>The gate gives its soft, familiar click. The house answers by becoming quieter, as if silence is something everyone has learned to do together.</p>
			<p>Priya is already awake. Not properly awake—just the kind of awake that winter insists on, where your mind opens one eye before your body agrees. From her bed she listens to the courtyard: her father’s sandals, the brief splash at the hand pump, the steel tumbler clinking against the tap.</p>
			<p>Sunita meets him at the doorway with tea the way she always does, steady and wordless. Rakesh takes the tumbler, warms his fingers around it, and then pulls something from the inside pocket of his jacket.</p>
			<p>A folded bundle of notes. Not thick, but thick enough to mean something.</p>
			<p>He places it on the edge of the trunk, like he’s putting down a tool.</p>
			<p>“This is for your form,” he says, and the sentence holds the tiredness of a night shift without complaining about it.</p>
			<p>Priya sits up.</p>
			<p>Sunita glances at her, the kind of glance that says: <em>Now, quietly. Don’t make it heavy.</em></p>
			<p>“Go today,” Sunita says, already moving toward the kitchen. “The bank will be open. First Saturday.”</p>
			<p>Priya’s stomach does its usual tightening, then loosening. The day has chosen a shape.</p>
			<p>In the kitchen, Sunita spreads an old newspaper on the counter as if money needs a clean place to be counted. Priya stands beside her, hair still half-tucked into sleep, and watches as her mother smooths the notes with quick thumbs.</p>
			<p>The sound is small: paper against paper, like dry leaves.</p>
			<p>“How much is it?” Priya asks.</p>
			<p>“Enough,” Sunita says, and that is the closest her mother comes to reassurance.</p>
			<p>Priya thinks of Sharma Ji’s list, his voice saying <em>fee receipt</em> the way people say <em>oxygen</em>. She thinks of Sana’s earlier urgency, and the way deadlines sit in the mind like an itch.</p>
			<p>She doesn’t ask where the money came from—not the exact part of it. She knows the answer: from the place where Rakesh keeps his nights.</p>
			<p>Breakfast is quick: yesterday’s rotis warmed on the tawa and a bit of pickle, because <em>quick</em> mornings have their own taste. Arjun wanders in, yawning, and picks up a roti as if he’s doing the family a favor by being alive.</p>
			<p>“You’re going to the bank?” he asks, noticing the plastic folder on the bed.</p>
			<p>Priya nods.</p>
			<p>He chews, then says, “Take the token fast. Don’t stand around like a lost goat.” He says it with the authority of someone who has never stood in a queue but has watched enough people complain to become wise.</p>
			<p>“Okay,” Priya says, and feels an unexpected laugh rise and settle back down.</p>
			<p>She folds the notes into a plain envelope and slips it into her cloth bag, deeper than the folder. She adds her phone, a pen, and the small notebook that turns worry into boxes you can tick.</p>
			<p>Before leaving, she steps into the room where Rakesh has already lain down. He has kicked off his sweater and folded his arm across his eyes, a posture that says: <em>don’t wake me unless there’s fire.</em></p>
			<p>Priya pauses at the doorway. She doesn’t say anything. Words feel too big for the moment.</p>
			<p>She just shuts the door gently and goes.</p>
			<p>Outside, the lane is brighter than yesterday, but the fog still sits in the low places like leftover milk skin. The sun has a weak edge; it makes the neem leaves look dusty-gold.</p>
			<p>At the bus stand, a few people are already arguing with time. Women hold passbooks and cloth bags. Men stand with hands in pockets, breath steaming. An old uncle taps his foot as if the bank will open faster out of fear.</p>
			<p>Priya stops at Chai Uncle’s stall for one tumbler, partly for warmth, partly because she has learned that beginnings go smoother when they include ginger.</p>
			<p>Chai Uncle sees the folder and the bag and immediately understands. “Bank work?” he asks.</p>
			<p>Priya nods.</p>
			<p>He makes a sympathetic sound. “First Saturday. Everyone suddenly remembers what they’ve been avoiding.”</p>
			<p>He hands her the tea and adds, “Be polite with the guard. Politeness moves faster than anger.”</p>
			<p>Priya laughs. “Is that your advice for 2026 too?”</p>
			<p>“Always,” he says, pleased with himself.</p>
			<p>The shared auto drops her near the bank branch in Mohanlalganj—the same building everyone points to with their chin, as if it’s a person. Outside, the line is already behaving like a living thing: stretching, compressing, growing a new head every time someone arrives.</p>
			<p>A guard stands near the door with a notebook. His moustache has the kind of confidence Priya can’t imagine having.</p>
			<p>“Line there,” he tells her, pointing.</p>
			<p>Priya joins the queue and immediately feels the way queues make you part of a temporary family. Everyone has the same posture: papers clutched, eyes scanning for movement, hope rationed out in small amounts.</p>
			<p>In front of her, a woman in a faded pink shawl turns around and gives Priya a quick once-over, the way women do—inventory, not judgement.</p>
			<p>“What work?” the woman asks.</p>
			<p>“College fee deposit,” Priya says.</p>
			<p>The woman nods as if Priya has confessed a common illness. “On Saturdays it’s always like this.”</p>
			<p>The guard calls numbers, writes something down, lets people in batches. Priya waits, shifting her weight from one foot to the other. Her fingers find the edge of the envelope inside her bag, checking it like a habit.</p>
			<p>Finally, it is her turn at the door.</p>
			<p>She steps forward and, remembering the shape of respect everyone here understands, calls the guard <em>bhaiya</em>—older brother, the safe word for strangers—and asks for a token for fee deposit.</p>
			<p>The guard glances at her face, then at her folder. Something in his expression softens by half a degree.</p>
			<p>“Forms?” he confirms.</p>
			<p>Priya nods.</p>
			<p>He flips the token register and tears off a slip. The number is printed in fat black ink: 27.</p>
			<p>The paper feels light, but the number feels like responsibility.</p>
			<p>Inside, the bank smells like paper that has been handled by too many hands. A ceiling fan turns slowly, pretending to work. The chairs are lined up like obedient students.</p>
			<p>Priya sits with her folder on her lap and watches the counters. People move forward, come back, sit down again, move forward again. It is a choreography of frustration and patience.</p>
			<p>On the wall, an LED display flashes token numbers. It makes a soft beep that sounds almost polite.</p>
			<p>Twenty-four. Twenty-five.</p>
			<p>Priya looks at her hands and realizes she has started tucking hair behind her ear without meaning to. She stops. Then she does it again. She can’t help it.</p>
			<p>Her phone buzzes.</p>
			<p>A message from Sana: <em>Reached the bank?</em></p>
			<p>Priya types with cold thumbs: <em>Yes. Token 27.</em></p>
			<p>Sana replies immediately: <em>Don’t leave without the stamp.</em></p>
			<p>Priya reads it twice. <em>Stamp.</em> Such a small word for such a large relief.</p>
			<p>Twenty-six.</p>
			<p>Twenty-seven.</p>
			<p>The beep comes again, and Priya stands up so quickly she almost knocks her folder against the chair.</p>
			<p>At the counter, the clerk doesn’t look like he hates his job; he looks like he has stopped having feelings about it. This is somehow worse.</p>
			<p>“What work?” he asks.</p>
			<p>Priya slides the challan printout and the form across, keeping her fingers on the edge until he has it properly. The envelope stays in her bag until the last possible second.</p>
			<p>“Fee,” she says. “For college.”</p>
			<p>The clerk flips the paper, squints, taps something on his computer. “Cash?”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” Priya says, and takes out the envelope.</p>
			<p>For a second, she feels everyone behind her watching her hands, not out of malice but out of the shared curiosity of people waiting: <em>will it go smoothly?</em></p>
			<p>She counts the notes carefully onto the counter. The clerk counts them again, faster, as if his fingers are paid by the second.</p>
			<p>Then he reaches for a stamp.</p>
			<p>It is purple, and slightly smudged, and it lands on the paper with a heavy <em>thup</em>.</p>
			<p>The ink spreads into a neat rectangle. Date. Branch. Authority.</p>
			<p>Something inside Priya unclenches.</p>
			<p>The clerk slides the stamped receipt back toward her without a smile. But Priya doesn’t need a smile. She has proof.</p>
			<p>“Next,” he calls.</p>
			<p>Outside, the air feels different. Not warmer, not less foggy—just less threatening.</p>
			<p>Priya walks quickly back toward the market lane, the stamped receipt pressed flat in the folder like a pressed flower. Sharma Ji’s shop is open; the phone covers outside are shining too brightly for January.</p>
			<p>Inside, Sharma Ji looks up and immediately says, “Done?”</p>
			<p>Priya nods and places the stamped paper on the counter with a kind of quiet pride.</p>
			<p>Sharma Ji makes an approving noise, which from him is the same as applause. “Good. Now upload.”</p>
			<p>The network is slow again, as if the internet also enjoys watching people suffer. Sharma Ji clicks, waits, clicks. The computer fan does its distant-train sound.</p>
			<p>Priya stands beside him, watching the loading circle, feeling time drip like the hand pump.</p>
			<p>Finally, the page accepts the file. A small confirmation message appears.</p>
			<p>Sharma Ji prints the acknowledgement and slides it across. “That’s it. Less tension.”</p>
			<p>Priya pays him and tucks the acknowledgement behind the stamped receipt. The plastic folder closes with a soft snap, like a box being shut.</p>
			<p>On the way home, she doesn’t stop for chai. She wants to reach the house while the feeling is still fresh, like warm bread.</p>
			<p>Sunita is in the courtyard when Priya arrives, sleeves rolled up, shaking a wet cloth. She sees Priya’s face and understands before Priya speaks.</p>
			<p>“Ho gaya?” Sunita asks—<em>done?</em>—and the two syllables hold a whole morning of waiting.</p>
			<p>Priya opens the folder and holds out the stamped receipt like a certificate.</p>
			<p>Sunita takes it, looks at the stamp, and lets out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding. Then she hands it back.</p>
			<p>“Put it up,” she says, meaning the shelf above the trunk, the safe place, the plastic-folder kingdom.</p>
			<p>Priya slides the papers into their sleeve and places the folder on the shelf, right where it belongs.</p>
			<p>In her squared notebook, she draws a small box and writes one line carefully:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Fee paid + receipt.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>She ticks the box so neatly it looks like a decision.</p>
			<p>In the next room, Rakesh is still asleep. Priya pours him a little tea and sets it near the bed. She doesn’t wake him. She just leaves the warmth there, a quiet reply to the envelope he left on the trunk.</p>
			<p>By late afternoon, the sun has moved to a new patch of the courtyard. The fog is gone for now, but Priya knows it will return in the evening like a relative who doesn’t knock.</p>
			<p>Arjun is watching cricket highlights on his phone, volume low because the house has learned its own softness. He glances up at Priya.</p>
			<p>“Done?” he asks, mouth full of peanuts.</p>
			<p>Priya nods.</p>
			<p>He raises an eyebrow, impressed despite himself. “So 2026 has actually started,” he says.</p>
			<p>Priya smiles. Not big, not dramatic. Just enough.</p>
			<p>In her bag, her phone buzzes again—another message from Sana, probably a celebration in all caps. Priya doesn’t open it immediately. She sits for a moment on the edge of the charpai, listening to the ordinary sounds: a pressure cooker far away, a bicycle bell, a neighbor calling a child inside.</p>
			<p>The stamp is dry now. The ink has settled.</p>
			<p>The day settles too, around the simple fact that something got done—properly, on time, with proof. In a year that is still mostly unknown, that feels like a good kind of beginning.</p>
