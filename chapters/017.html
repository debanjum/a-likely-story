			<p>Saturday morning comes in quietly, like someone entering a room where an old man is sleeping.</p>
			<p>Rakesh is not old, but he returns from his shift before dawn, and the house treats that hour with the same respect. The gate clicks. A bicycle bell somewhere asks a question. Then the lane becomes blank again under fog.</p>
			<p>Priya hears the sounds through her shawl and keeps her eyes closed for a minute, listening for the moment when the house decides it is safe to breathe normally.</p>
			<p>In the kitchen, Sunita’s bangles make a soft clink. The kettle argues with the stove. The smell of chai spreads, familiar as a blanket.</p>
			<p>“<em>Aa gaye?</em> (Has he come?)” Priya whispers, not sure who she is asking.</p>
			<p>Sunita answers from the darkness with a practical hum. “Haan (yes). He will sleep now. Don’t make noise.”</p>
			<p>The day is Saturday, but in winter all days feel like they are made of the same cold material. The difference is only in what people expect from you.</p>
			<p>Priya sits up and looks at her phone.</p>
			<p>A small notification sits there like a pebble:</p>
			<p>Sana: <em>Good morning madam typist.</em></p>
			<p>Priya smiles before she can stop herself.</p>
			<p>She opens the chat.</p>
			<p>Sana has replied to yesterday’s message with a typed line (it looks strange and grown-up, coming from Sana instead of arriving as voice): <em>Ok. Today 4 pm? I will bring notes. Also you will type my name nicely now.</em></p>
			<p>Priya types back, slow and careful.</p>
			<p><em>4 pm ok. I will try.</em></p>
			<p>She reads it once.</p>
			<p>She doesn’t change it.</p>
			<p>The fact of sending words without shrinking them still feels new.</p>
			<p>In the corner of the room, her keyboard waits beside her books. Yesterday she left it a little uncovered—like a tool, not a secret.</p>
			<p>She pulls it closer and plugs in the OTG connector. The tiny cable feels like it should belong to someone who knows what they are doing, not to her.</p>
			<p>Her phone flashes the message again: <em>Physical keyboard connected.</em></p>
			<p>Priya doesn’t fully understand the English, but she likes the certainty of the word <em>connected.</em></p>
			<p>She sets a timer for fifteen minutes.</p>
			<p>It is the same promise as yesterday, but Saturday gives promises more room to grow.</p>
			<p>Her practice website opens to a new line:</p>
			<p><em>please keep distance</em></p>
			<p>Priya snorts.</p>
			<p>Even the phone is repeating the world’s advice.</p>
			<p>She begins.</p>
			<p>The keys click. Letters appear. Mistakes come and are removed. The space bar makes small, clean gaps like breath.</p>
			<p>From the courtyard, Sunita calls softly, “Priya, coriander is finished.”</p>
			<p>“After fifteen minutes,” Priya says, surprising herself with how firm it sounds.</p>
			<p>Sunita doesn’t argue. She is the kind of woman who respects a timer once she understands it is serious.</p>
			<p>When the alarm rings, Priya stops.</p>
			<p>Her fingers want to keep going, but she unplugs the keyboard anyway, because she is practicing something else too: stopping when she said she would.</p>
			<p>She folds the little connector cable into its packet and puts it in the plastic folder for a moment—then laughs at herself.</p>
			<p>A connector is not a document.</p>
			<p>But she understands the feeling. If something is important, it goes in the folder. It becomes safe.</p>
			<p>She leaves it there anyway.</p>
			<p>In the courtyard, Sunita pours chai into steel tumblers and slides one toward Rakesh’s sleeping form without waking him. Tea near his bed is the family’s quiet language.</p>
			<p>Arjun appears, hair sticking up as if even his scalp is annoyed by the cold.</p>
			<p>“Saturday,” he declares, like it is an invention.</p>
			<p>“Brush your teeth,” Sunita says.</p>
			<p>Arjun groans and shuffles away.</p>
			<p>Priya wraps her scarf high and goes out with a cloth bag for vegetables.</p>
			<p>Fog makes the lane feel shorter and longer at the same time. Things arrive late, and then suddenly they are right in front of you: a buffalo’s back, shining with damp; a woman carrying fodder; a schoolboy who looks surprised to be awake on a Saturday.</p>
			<p>At the bus stand, Chai Uncle is present, as always, like a landmark.</p>
			<p>He is pouring chai and listening to a small radio that keeps trying to be cheerful.</p>
			<p>The newsreader says something about delays and cancellations.</p>
			<p>“Trains,” Chai Uncle announces to no one in particular. “Fog has eaten trains also. Winter is very greedy.”</p>
			<p>A man on the bench shakes his phone. “Northern Railway cancelled many, they said. From December to February.”</p>
			<p>Priya listens with half an ear. Trains are a world that passes near her but does not belong to her daily life. Still, the idea that fog can cancel something as big as a train makes her respect the weather’s power.</p>
			<p>Chai Uncle looks at her scarf and says, “Today you are going to become computer madam?”</p>
			<p>Priya smiles. “Only vegetables today.”</p>
			<p>“Vegetables also need typing,” he says, and laughs at his own joke.</p>
			<p>She buys coriander and potatoes from the market lane, bargaining lightly because Sunita expects her to try. Her fingers sting in the cold when she touches the wet greens.</p>
			<p>Back home, Sunita is kneading dough.</p>
			<p>Priya places the coriander down like a trophy.</p>
			<p>Sunita nods once, approval delivered without ceremony.</p>
			<p>Then, as if remembering an unfinished sentence, Sunita says, “Your father’s phone is making noise.”</p>
			<p>Priya looks toward the charpai.</p>
			<p>Rakesh’s phone is vibrating on the floor, stubbornly, like it has decided this is not a day for sleep.</p>
			<p>Priya picks it up.</p>
			<p>A message from the warehouse group.</p>
			<p>She doesn’t understand every word, but she understands enough: fog, delayed, report later.</p>
			<p>Sunita watches her face.</p>
			<p>“What is it?”</p>
			<p>“Fog,” Priya says. “They are saying come late. Or maybe… they will change.”</p>
			<p>Sunita makes a small annoyed sound again, aimed at the fog like it can hear.</p>
			<p>Rakesh stirs.</p>
			<p>He blinks up at them, face tired and soft.</p>
			<p>“What happened?” he asks.</p>
			<p>Priya hands him the phone.</p>
			<p>He squints at the message, reading slowly.</p>
			<p>“Supervisor says don’t rush,” he says. Then he sits up with the reluctant movement of someone who has already spent his energy.</p>
			<p>He begins typing a reply with two thumbs.</p>
			<p>His thumbs are large and impatient. The letters come out wrong.</p>
			<p>Rakesh mutters under his breath, deletes, tries again.</p>
			<p>Priya watches for a second, then says carefully, “I can type.”</p>
			<p>Rakesh looks at her.</p>
			<p>It is not disbelief. It is the strange new respect of someone noticing a skill becoming real.</p>
			<p>“Type then,” he says, and hands her the phone like he is handing her a tool from his own work.</p>
			<p>Priya’s stomach tightens.</p>
			<p>Typing to Sana is one thing.</p>
			<p>Typing to a supervisor is another.</p>
			<p>Words can travel and come back with consequences.</p>
			<p>She goes to her room and brings the keyboard.</p>
			<p>Sunita follows her, curious now.</p>
			<p>Priya plugs the keyboard into Rakesh’s phone with the OTG connector.</p>
			<p>For a second she worries it will not work on his phone.</p>
			<p>Then the message appears again: <em>Physical keyboard connected.</em></p>
			<p>Connected.</p>
			<p>She opens the chat.</p>
			<p>The supervisor’s last message sits there like a bell waiting to be answered.</p>
			<p>Rakesh says, “Write: I will come, but bus is late. Fog.”</p>
			<p>Priya looks at the blank reply box.</p>
			<p>She types, slowly, in simple English because that is what the group uses.</p>
			<p><em>Sir, bus is late because very dense fog. I will reach a little late. I am coming.</em></p>
			<p>She reads it.</p>
			<p>She wants to add apology, remove apology, add another line, remove another line.</p>
			<p>She hears Sharma Ji’s voice in her head: <em>Don’t play. Practice.</em></p>
			<p>She presses send.</p>
			<p>The message goes.</p>
			<p>Rakesh stares at it.</p>
			<p>He nods once, like a stamp.</p>
			<p>“Good,” he says.</p>
			<p>Sunita’s eyes go to Priya’s hands on the keys.</p>
			<p>Priya can feel her mother doing her quiet calculations: money, time, trouble, possibility.</p>
			<p>After a minute, the supervisor replies with a short thumbs-up.</p>
			<p>Rakesh exhales.</p>
			<p>It is a small thing.</p>
			<p>But the relief in the courtyard is real, like the first warm patch of sun that appears on a wall in winter.</p>
			<p>Rakesh drinks his chai and rests back down.</p>
			<p>“Wake me at eleven,” he says. “If fog becomes less, I will go.”</p>
			<p>Sunita agrees.</p>
			<p>Priya carries the keyboard back to her room, careful again, like it can break if she is careless.</p>
			<p>By afternoon, the fog thins and thickens in waves, never fully leaving.</p>
			<p>At four, Sana arrives with her scarf pulled up, cheeks pink from the cold.</p>
			<p>She holds up a notebook like a weapon.</p>
			<p>“Study,” she announces.</p>
			<p>Priya makes tea. They sit near the doorway where light is best, because the room feels too dark in winter.</p>
			<p>Sana flips through notes and points at a paragraph.</p>
			<p>“Read,” she says.</p>
			<p>Priya reads aloud, halting at English words and letting Sana correct her without making it feel like a wound.</p>
			<p>When Sana pauses to drink tea, she looks at Priya’s keyboard.</p>
			<p>“You really bought,” Sana says, impressed.</p>
			<p>Priya nods, trying not to show too much pride.</p>
			<p>Sana grins. “Now type my name.”</p>
			<p>Priya rolls her eyes. “No.”</p>
			<p>Sana laughs and then, softer, says, “Good. You are doing it. You are not just talking.</p>
			<p>And you typed for your father?”</p>
			<p>Priya blinks. “How do you know?”</p>
			<p>Sana waves her phone. “Arjun sent voice note. He said: <em>Didi typed like office</em>—like a real office.”</p>
			<p>Priya groans.</p>
			<p>Arjun has made her into news.</p>
			<p>Sana’s laughter fills the small room, bright as a match.</p>
			<p>When Sana leaves before evening, Priya walks her to the lane.</p>
			<p>The fog is back again, gently pushing the world into softer edges.</p>
			<p>On the way back, Priya looks at her phone.</p>
			<p>No new portal messages.</p>
			<p>No new proofs.</p>
			<p>Just the small fact that her words reached someone and returned as a thumbs-up.</p>
			<p>At night, she plugs in the keyboard again.</p>
			<p>She sets the timer.</p>
			<p>Fifteen minutes.</p>
			<p>Not because she is afraid of doing more.</p>
			<p>Because she wants to be the kind of person who can do a small thing every day and trust it will grow.</p>
			<p>Outside, the fog presses its face to the courtyard.</p>
			<p>Inside, Priya’s hands move in clean, steady clicks.</p>
			<p>And for once, the day ends without her needing to check anything twice.</p>
