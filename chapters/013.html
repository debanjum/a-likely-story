			<p>Tuesday arrives with a sharper edge.</p>
			<p>The fog is still there, but it has stopped pretending to be polite. It sits low over the lane like a thin, stubborn sheet, and the cold—returned like a person who forgot their umbrella—finds every gap around the windows.</p>
			<p>Sunita is already awake, banging the steel <em>dabba</em> tins (storage boxes) softly so they don’t become loud. Sesame seeds are roasted in small batches, as if the pan itself might get tired.</p>
			<p>“Today you’ll take the quilts down,” she tells Arjun, who is standing in the doorway with his hands inside his sweater like a kangaroo.</p>
			<p>Arjun makes a sound that means <em>I heard you</em> and also <em>I will do it five minutes later</em>. Then he looks at the kitchen counter.</p>
			<p>“Maa, are we making <em>khichdi</em> (rice-and-lentil khichdi) tomorrow?” he asks.</p>
			<p>Sunita nods. “Tomorrow is Makar Sankranti. <em>Khichdi</em> tomorrow.”</p>
			<p>Priya watches Sunita’s hands pinch and release—sesame, jaggery, sesame again. The smell of melted <em>gur</em> (jaggery) is warm in the nose, even when the air is not.</p>
			<p>Priya’s own hands want to do something different. They want the predictable bumps of F and J. They want the click that means a letter has arrived safely.</p>
			<p>She opens her notebook and flips to the page where she has been keeping her tiny new accounts.</p>
			<p><em>KEYBOARD</em> is written at the top in block letters, a little too serious for the amount of money underneath.</p>
			<p>₹120.</p>
			<p>She draws a line.</p>
			<p>₹250 (needed).</p>
			<p>₹130 (left).</p>
			<p>She looks at the numbers the way she sometimes looks at the college portal: not for comfort, but for information.</p>
			<p>Sunita notices.</p>
			<p>“How much now?” she asks, as casually as asking whether the salt is finished.</p>
			<p>“One-twenty,” Priya says.</p>
			<p>Sunita hums. “Slowly. But it is moving.”</p>
			<p>Arjun leans over, reads the word KEYBOARD and immediately finds it funny.</p>
			<p>“Didi will become computer madam,” he says. “Then you’ll type my homework also. Full speed. Like TikTok captions.”</p>
			<p>Priya nudges him with her elbow. “First learn spelling.”</p>
			<p>Arjun laughs, but he also takes the quilts down from the rope on the roof without being asked again.</p>
			<p>Rakesh wakes late morning, the way he always does after a night shift: not fully awake at first, just present in the house like a shadow that slowly becomes a person. He sits in the courtyard with his back to the sun and warms his hands around a steel tumbler.</p>
			<p>“Cold is back,” he says.</p>
			<p>“Cold never went,” Sunita replies.</p>
			<p>Priya slides a <em>til laddoo</em>—a sesame sweet—toward him.</p>
			<p>Rakesh takes a bite, chews, and then—because fathers in this house rarely say the emotional thing directly—asks, “Sharma Ji is still letting you sit?”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” Priya says. “And sometimes… he gives work.”</p>
			<p>Rakesh nods once, satisfied with the shape of the sentence.</p>
			<p>By noon, Priya is walking toward the bus stand with her sweater zipped up to her chin. The lane is busy in the festival-before way: not celebration, exactly, but preparation. People carry small plastic bags that look heavier than they should.</p>
			<p>At Chai Uncle’s stall, the stove is working like a loyal employee.</p>
			<p>Chai Uncle sees her and taps the counter with a spoon. “Madam fingers! Today also?”</p>
			<p>“Just practice,” Priya says. “And… maybe market.”</p>
			<p>He pours her chai with extra ginger without asking.</p>
			<p>“Tomorrow Sankranti,” he says, as if announcing a train schedule. “Everyone will eat <em>khichdi</em> and become holy.”</p>
			<p>Priya smiles into the steam.</p>
			<p>A man beside her is scrolling through his phone and narrating the weather to no one.</p>
			<p>“IMD says cold wave, fog, alert—alert,” he says, repeating the word like it is itself a warning.</p>
			<p>Chai Uncle snorts. “Alert is for people with cars. For us, it is just… sweater.”</p>
			<p>Priya warms her palms, finishes the chai, and walks to Sharma Ji’s shop.</p>
			<p>The shop is crowded again.</p>
			<p>Not the Monday crowd of forms and photocopies, but the Sankranti crowd of small things that feel urgent because tomorrow is a holiday for some people and only a festival for others.</p>
			<p>One boy wants a printout of a WhatsApp invitation card with a peacock border.</p>
			<p>A woman wants “two copies, colour, and one with the date bigger.”</p>
			<p>Someone’s printer job has jammed, and the paper has emerged like a crumpled apology.</p>
			<p>Sharma Ji is moving between tasks with the expression of a man who has accepted that human beings will always need paper.</p>
			<p>He sees Priya and points, without looking up, to the chair near the second computer.</p>
			<p>“Ten minutes,” he says.</p>
			<p>Priya sits. She takes a breath. She places her fingers on the home row.</p>
			<p>F. J.</p>
			<p>The bumps.</p>
			<p>Her shoulders drop slightly, like they were waiting for permission.</p>
			<p>On the screen is a blank document. She types her name ten times, as assigned.</p>
			<p>PRIYA VERMA.</p>
			<p>PRIYA VERMA.</p>
			<p>Her spacing is even. Her backspace use is less panicked now. The letters are no longer strangers.</p>
			<p>A small boy watches from behind, too close.</p>
			<p>“Didi, you are writing without seeing,” he says, amazed, as if she is doing a magic trick.</p>
			<p>Priya glances at him. “I am seeing,” she says. “Only… not here.” She taps her eyes lightly and then her fingers.</p>
			<p>He looks at her hands with new respect, the way people look at a musician’s fingers.</p>
			<p>Sharma Ji drops a thin bundle of papers onto the desk beside her.</p>
			<p>“Type these names,” he says. “For tomorrow’s distribution list. In English. Correct spelling. Don’t make someone become someone else.”</p>
			<p>Priya picks up the top sheet.</p>
			<p>It is a list of shop customers—names and mobile numbers—written neatly but with the kind of handwriting that makes ‘u’ and ‘n’ want to exchange clothes.</p>
			<p>She nods. “Okay.”</p>
			<p>The work is not hard like lifting sacks, but it is heavy in a different way. Each name is somebody’s identity. Each digit is somebody’s phone, somebody’s argument if it goes wrong.</p>
			<p>Priya types slowly and checks each line twice.</p>
			<p>She is halfway through when Irfan walks in.</p>
			<p>He pauses at the door, as if deciding whether to enter a temple or a crowded bus.</p>
			<p>When he sees Priya at the keyboard, his face changes—just a fraction—into a smile.</p>
			<p>“Working?” he asks.</p>
			<p>Priya keeps her eyes on the screen. “Working,” she says.</p>
			<p>Irfan nods as if that answers a question he has been asking quietly for weeks.</p>
			<p>He waits near the counter, hands in his jacket pockets, not hovering. Priya appreciates that.</p>
			<p>When she finishes, Sharma Ji prints the list and scans it quickly with his eyes like a man checking a fence.</p>
			<p>“Hmm,” he says. Then he pulls out notes, counts, and pushes ₹50 toward her.</p>
			<p>“Only fifty,” he says, as if apologizing to his own wallet. “But you were careful.”</p>
			<p>Priya takes it.</p>
			<p>₹170 now.</p>
			<p>Only eighty left.</p>
			<p>Her stomach does a small, quiet dance.</p>
			<p>On the way out, she stops at the market lane.</p>
			<p>The second-hand shop is open, and the keyboards are still there, stacked like black loaves.</p>
			<p>The same one she saw on Sunday sits on top. A little dust in the corners. One key slightly shiny from overuse.</p>
			<p>The shopkeeper lifts it, shakes it like a watermelon.</p>
			<p>“Two-fifty,” he says, as if the number will not change even if she looks at it hard.</p>
			<p>Priya looks at the keyboard.</p>
			<p>She thinks of her envelope.</p>
			<p>She thinks of Sunita’s hands rolling laddoos without complaining.</p>
			<p>She thinks of Rakesh’s one nod.</p>
			<p>She thinks of the boy behind her saying: <em>you are writing without seeing</em>.</p>
			<p>“I have one-seventy,” she says, truthful, but also strategic. “I am saving. If you keep it for me, I will take.”</p>
			<p>The shopkeeper laughs, not unkindly. “Everyone is saving. Everyone wants discount.”</p>
			<p>Priya doesn’t laugh. She waits.</p>
			<p>The shopkeeper looks at her face and realizes she is not playing.</p>
			<p>“Come tomorrow?” he says.</p>
			<p>“Tomorrow is festival,” Priya says. “I will be at home.”</p>
			<p>“Then day after.”</p>
			<p>Priya nods. “Day after.”</p>
			<p>She leaves without buying.</p>
			<p>Her steps feel light and heavy at the same time.</p>
			<p>At home, Sunita has wrapped <em>til laddoo</em> in small pieces of newspaper—carefully, so the print doesn’t smear onto the sweet. She is making a plate of offerings for tomorrow morning: sesame sweets, peanuts, a little jaggery, and the ingredients for <em>khichdi</em> (rice and lentils) set aside like a promise.</p>
			<p>Arjun is folding paper into a kite shape, badly.</p>
			<p>“It will fly,” he claims.</p>
			<p>“It will fall,” Priya says.</p>
			<p>Arjun points at her bag. “Did you buy keyboard?”</p>
			<p>Priya takes out her notebook first. She shows him the ₹50 folded inside.</p>
			<p>Arjun whistles. “Didi is earning.”</p>
			<p>“Don’t whistle inside the house,” Sunita says automatically, even though she doesn’t fully believe the superstition. It is more like keeping the air disciplined.</p>
			<p>Priya goes to the shelf and opens the KEYBOARD envelope.</p>
			<p>₹120 + ₹50 = ₹170.</p>
			<p>She writes it down in her notebook.</p>
			<p>Then she writes another line below it:</p>
			<p>₹80 left.</p>
			<p>It looks smaller on paper.</p>
			<p>In the evening, the lane smells faintly of smoke. Somewhere, someone has lit a small bonfire—maybe because of the cold, maybe because they have heard of Lohri from a neighbour who worked in Punjab once, maybe just because fire is always convincing.</p>
			<p>Arjun stands at the gate and warms his hands like an old man.</p>
			<p>“Lohri today,” he announces, as if he is in charge of the calendar.</p>
			<p>Priya raises an eyebrow. “Since when do we celebrate Lohri?”</p>
			<p>Arjun shrugs. “We are celebrating ‘hands warm’ festival.”</p>
			<p>Sunita laughs once, sharp and quick, then returns to her work.</p>
			<p>Priya sits on her bed with her notebook open on her lap.</p>
			<p>She checks the college portal once.</p>
			<p>Still: <em>under review</em>.</p>
			<p>She doesn’t refresh.</p>
			<p>Instead, she puts her hands on the blanket and imagines the keyboard.</p>
			<p>F and J.</p>
			<p>The bumps.</p>
			<p>A screen is helpful, yes. But she is learning something older than screens: where her fingers belong when she wants to make a thing real.</p>
			<p>Outside, the smoke drifts and the winter night tightens its shawl.</p>
			<p>Priya closes her notebook.</p>
			<p>Tomorrow there will be <em>khichdi</em>, and sesame sweets, and the small movement of festival inside ordinary life.</p>
			<p>And the day after, she thinks, there might be a keyboard.</p>
			<p>Not yet.</p>
			<p>But close enough now that she can hear it.</p>
