			<p>Thursday morning begins with a sound before it begins with light.</p>
			<p>It is the kettle’s first complaint—soft at the edges, then sharper—like it is clearing its throat for the day.</p>
			<p>Priya wakes to it and to the faint, familiar cold that sits on the quilt as if it has decided to stay. For a second she forgets what day it is, and then she remembers the desk woman’s drawer-voice:</p>
			<p><em>Tomorrow. Ten.</em></p>
			<p>She sits up quickly and the cold bites her ankles in retaliation.</p>
			<p>On the stool near the plastic folder, the passport photos lie like little identical strangers: Priya’s face, twice, printed too smooth and too serious. In the studio yesterday she tried not to smile too hard; now she looks like someone who knows where she is going.</p>
			<p>Arjun notices them first, because Arjun notices anything that looks like it might be used to tease.</p>
			<p>He comes out rubbing his eyes and says, “Didi (big sister), you are looking like bank manager.”</p>
			<p>Priya flicks a corner of the photo strip at him. “Go brush,” she says.</p>
			<p>Sunita pours tea into steel tumblers and glances at the photos without touching them, as if to touch would be to jinx.</p>
			<p>“Keep them inside the folder,” she says. “Don’t fold. Don’t lose.”</p>
			<p>Priya slides the photo strip into the plastic folder, between the BA confirmation slip and the home-row practice sheet, and the plastic makes that little sealed sound she has started to love.</p>
			<p>The extra Aadhaar copy—fresh, bright—goes in too.</p>
			<p>Outside, the fog isn’t as thick as yesterday, but it is still present in the way a neighbour is present: you don’t see them always, but you feel their eyes on the lane.</p>
			<p>Priya checks the time.</p>
			<p>08:22.</p>
			<p>She plugs her keyboard into her phone for exactly five minutes—not because she needs to, but because it settles her hands.</p>
			<p>She types:</p>
			<p><em>clinic 10</em></p>
			<p>and then, on a new line:</p>
			<p><em>photo + aadhaar</em></p>
			<p>and then, after a pause:</p>
			<p><em>don’t hurry because of faces</em></p>
			<p>She reads it once and unplugs.</p>
			<p>Rakesh is awake today. He sits on the charpai in the inner room, rubbing his forehead as if he is trying to iron out a thought.</p>
			<p>“Going again?” he asks.</p>
			<p>“Haan (yes),” Priya says, and then adds, because she is learning to speak like her lists, “Ten o’clock.”</p>
			<p>Rakesh nods. His eyes move briefly to the folder in her hand.</p>
			<p>“Careful,” he says.</p>
			<p>It is the same word he uses for the gas knob, for Arjun crossing the road, for money. It is not dramatic. It is an instruction.</p>
			<p>At the bus stand, Chai Uncle has already made the first round of glasses shine. He sees Priya and raises an eyebrow like a small flag.</p>
			<p>“Second day,” he says, and it is not a question.</p>
			<p>Priya smiles. “Second day.”</p>
			<p>He pours her chai and adds a little extra adrak (ginger) without asking. “Cold is making everyone feel like old people,” he declares. “All bones complaining.”</p>
			<p>A man nearby scrolls his phone and reads out loud again, as if the act of saying it will push it away. “Fog warning,” he announces. “Drive carefully. Visibility very less.”</p>
			<p>“We are driving with hope,” Chai Uncle says, and someone laughs.</p>
			<p>Priya warms her fingers around the glass. The fog makes the distances strange; a shared auto that looks close is suddenly far. A dog that looks alone is suddenly in a group.</p>
			<p>When the auto comes, she sits in the back again, folder pressed to her stomach as if it is a small animal.</p>
			<p>On the Lucknow side roads, the morning opens a little. There are more buses, more horns, more people walking with their shoulders lifted against the cold.</p>
			<p>Near a crossing, she sees a man selling marigold garlands—bright yellow circles against the grey. For a moment, the colour looks almost rude.</p>
			<p>“Kal basant panchami hai (tomorrow is Vasant Panchami),” a woman says as she passes, holding a yellow dupatta against her chest.</p>
			<p>Priya hears it and files it away with all the other near-future things: Republic Day posters that will come soon, school practice songs, the next BA assignment Sana will mention.</p>
			<p>The clinic board appears on time today.</p>
			<p>Inside, the desk woman looks up when Priya enters.</p>
			<p>“Photos?” she asks immediately.</p>
			<p>Priya pulls out the strip.</p>
			<p>The desk woman takes it the way she takes everything—efficient, without ceremony—and tears two photos off with a practiced thumb.</p>
			<p>“And Aadhaar copy,” she says.</p>
			<p>Priya hands over the paper.</p>
			<p>The desk woman opens a drawer, makes a small pile, and then points at a single-sheet form. “Fill this. Your details.”</p>
			<p>Priya’s stomach dips.</p>
			<p>Her own details.</p>
			<p>She sits at the edge of the counter and picks up the pen. The form has boxes that are familiar now: Name. Father’s name. Address. Mobile number. Pin code.</p>
			<p>Her hand hesitates at the mobile number, not because she doesn’t know it, but because it feels suddenly important in a new way. A wrong digit here would not be a small mistake. It would be a door that doesn’t open.</p>
			<p>She writes slowly.</p>
			<p>One digit at a time.</p>
			<p>When she reaches pin code, her fingers remember the six numbers the way they remember home-row bumps.</p>
			<p>226301.</p>
			<p>She looks at it, then looks again, then underlines nothing—just trusts it.</p>
			<p>The desk woman takes the filled sheet and glances over it quickly. “Okay,” she says, and then, almost as an afterthought: “PAN you don’t have?”</p>
			<p>“No, madam,” Priya says.</p>
			<p>“Later you make,” the desk woman says, as if PAN cards grow on trees and can be plucked when the season is right. “Not today.”</p>
			<p>Priya nods, relieved, and watches as the desk woman staples one passport photo to the top corner of the form.</p>
			<p>The stapler makes a sharp, satisfied sound.</p>
			<p><em>Click.</em></p>
			<p>Priya’s own face is now attached to paper that is going into a drawer.</p>
			<p>For a second she feels like she has been pinned gently into the world.</p>
			<p>The first patient arrives while she is still watching.</p>
			<p>The desk woman slides the register toward Priya. “Start,” she says.</p>
			<p>Today the work moves faster, not because Priya is suddenly fast, but because she is less afraid of the sequence. Register first. Computer second. Print when needed. Ask when unclear.</p>
			<p>A man gives a phone number too quickly.</p>
			<p>Priya lifts her eyes. “Number not clear—please tell again,” she says.</p>
			<p>He repeats it, a little slower. She types it. She repeats the last two digits back.</p>
			<p>He nods.</p>
			<p>The desk woman does not praise. She does not scold. She keeps the pen moving.</p>
			<p>That calm is starting to feel like an atmosphere.</p>
			<p>By mid-morning, the waiting area fills in layers. People come in with scarves and complaints and small folded papers that have names written by someone else.</p>
			<p>A mother hands Priya a slip. “This is my child’s date of birth,” she says. “Write correct.”</p>
			<p>Priya looks at the numbers on the slip and feels a brief wave of gratitude for the fact that paper, at least, stays still.</p>
			<p>She enters it carefully.</p>
			<p>The printer behaves today, but the paper tray is already part of Priya’s awareness—like a stove you keep checking even when the flame is low.</p>
			<p>At one point, the doctor steps out and says something quick to the desk woman about medicines running low.</p>
			<p>The desk woman turns to Priya. “Make list,” she says, and points to a notepad.</p>
			<p>Priya writes the medicine names as the desk woman dictates—half Hindi, half English, the spellings strange but steady.</p>
			<p>When she isn’t sure of a letter, she asks.</p>
			<p>The desk woman pauses, repeats, and Priya writes it again.</p>
			<p>No one gets angry.</p>
			<p>That is a new kind of luxury.</p>
			<p>Near noon, a man in a wool cap says loudly, “Tomorrow holiday, no?”</p>
			<p>Another man replies, “Basant panchami,” and laughs like the word itself is sweet.</p>
			<p>Priya feels the day of tomorrow press up against today like a page under another page.</p>
			<p>At 12:10, the desk woman finally nods at Priya’s bag. “Eat,” she says. “Five minute.”</p>
			<p>Priya opens the roti Sunita packed. The pickle is sharp and wakes her mouth. The clinic smells faintly of antiseptic and winter clothes that have not dried properly.</p>
			<p>While she eats, the desk woman holds Priya’s filled form up again and writes something at the bottom.</p>
			<p>Then she looks at Priya. “Tomorrow also you come,” she says. “Ten. Then we see.”</p>
			<p>Priya swallows.</p>
			<p>“Yes, madam,” she says, and tries to keep her face normal even as something inside her wants to bounce.</p>
			<p><em>Then we see.</em></p>
			<p>It is not a yes. It is not a no.</p>
			<p>It is the space between.</p>
			<p>When Priya leaves at one-thirty, the desk woman counts notes again and places them on the table.</p>
			<p>“Two hundred,” she says.</p>
			<p>Same as yesterday.</p>
			<p>Priya takes them and feels the paper edges bite her palm lightly—proof with corners.</p>
			<p>Outside, the air is brighter. The fog has pulled back to the edges of the day. People walk faster now, as if they can finally see where they are going.</p>
			<p>On the way home, Priya stops at Sharma Ji’s shop because her mind has already become a list of next steps.</p>
			<p>Sharma Ji looks up from his screen. “Clinic?” he asks.</p>
			<p>Priya nods.</p>
			<p>He makes a sound that could be approval or indigestion.</p>
			<p>“PAN they asked?” he says, as if he can smell bureaucracy.</p>
			<p>Priya blinks. “Yes. But madam said later.”</p>
			<p>Sharma Ji grunts. “Later means soon. Bring Aadhaar. Bring photo. Bring mobile. We can do.”</p>
			<p>He does not ask if she has money for it. He does not offer sympathy. He just lays out the requirements like he is setting spoons on a tray.</p>
			<p>Priya nods and feels strangely comforted. Paperwork, at least, has a shape.</p>
			<p>At home, Sunita is rolling leftover til laddoo (sesame-sweet) mixture into small balls for tomorrow. “For Saraswati,” she says, as if Saraswati also likes sesame.</p>
			<p>Priya hands her the two notes.</p>
			<p>Sunita smooths them and puts them into the tin.</p>
			<p>“Tomorrow you will go again?” she asks.</p>
			<p>“Yes,” Priya says. “Madam said come. Then we see.”</p>
			<p>Sunita’s mouth lifts at one corner. “Achha (okay),” she says. “Then we see also.”</p>
			<p>Arjun appears with a school notebook and says, too casually, “Our PT sir said Republic Day practice starting. We have to sing ‘Vande Mataram’ also.”</p>
			<p>He says it in English-heavy pronunciation, making it sound like a foreign dish.</p>
			<p>Sunita throws a sesame crumb at him. “Sing properly then.”</p>
			<p>Priya laughs, and the laugh feels like it comes from somewhere that has loosened.</p>
			<p>In the evening, she plugs in her keyboard and opens her phone.</p>
			<p>She types a new list:</p>
			<p><em>tomorrow: clinic 10</em></p>
			<p><em>carry: aadhaar copy (1), pen</em></p>
			<p>Then she adds a new line, because life keeps adding lines:</p>
			<p><em>PAN: ask Sharma Ji</em></p>
			<p>Finally, she writes the sentence that has started to feel like a rule and a prayer at once:</p>
			<p><em>don’t guess.</em></p>
			<p>She sets the timer.</p>
			<p>Fifteen minutes.</p>
			<p>Outside, someone in the lane is already calling out for marigolds. Yellow is moving closer.</p>
			<p>Inside, Priya’s fingers find the bumps on F and J without looking, and the keys answer back with their small, steady sound—like footsteps in a place she is slowly learning to belong to.</p>
